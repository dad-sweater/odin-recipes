    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>A quick and easy recipe with veggies, ground meat of your choice, and a spicy sauce. It can be served alongside
        anything you want. I've done mashed potatoes, rice, beans, and I've even put it on toast. I haven't tried it myself but I 
        assume that the recipe will be more or less the same if you swap out the meat with vegan meat.

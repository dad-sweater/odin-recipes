    <!-- Description section -->
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>A simple dish and a staple of Chinese takeout restaurants. This can be made with virtually any protein and simple vegetables.
        It is very important that the rice be washed and <em>ideally</em> the rice should be chilled in the fridge for at least 4 hours.
        Vegetable amounts and choices can be altered as you wish. Once it's done, it will keep in the fridge for a few 
        days and don't forget to spice it up with some sriracha!
